# An analysis on customer loyalty and satisfaction through NPS survey post Covid-19 pandemic of Imaginary Childcare

## Disclaimer
- Due to the lack of information on the assigned organization and the data acquisition approach, the author actively generalised Imaginary as a fiction childcare center and made several assumptions regarding the business and the data in order to move forward with the analysis process. <strong>Please use the insights derived from this notebook for reference purposes only.</strong>

## Introduction
### Net promoter system
Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a simple method of measuring the overall likelihood of a customer to recommend a product, service or company to a friend or family's member. 

In this analysis, the Net Promoter Score (NPS), on a scale from 0 to 10, evaluates the likelihood that parents would recommend Imaginary Childcare services at centres around Australia to their colleagues or friends.

* Customers who score 9 and 10 are classified as Promoters
* Customers who score 7 and 8 are classified as Neutral/Passive
* Customers who score 0 and 6 are classified as Detractors 

To calculate NPS: <strong>NPS = (Promoters - Detractors)/Total ratings * 100</strong>
